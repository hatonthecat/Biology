# Biology

10/23/2023

After randomly browsing some articles, I came across this reecnt Nature paper published around 3 weeks ago: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06600-9 It is one of those "theory of everything" papers, but applied to Biology, rather than the physics portrayed on the History Channel (just outer space and "Aliens"). The paper goes further than many in that, it adds a convenient layer of abstraction by, "redefnes the concept of an ‘object’ on which these laws act." This is to help understand some of the early forces of physics that led to the first biochemistry, rather than add a layer of abstraction for arbitrary or obfuscatory purposes. The rebuttal in one of the comments by Sara Walker, is phenomenal.

In Between 2006 and 2010, Carl Woese and Nigel Goldenfeld collaborated on some papers that discussed evolution as a physical phenomena: 

https://arxiv.org/pdf/1011.4125.pdf "Life is physics: evolution as a collective phenomenon far from equilibrium" (2010)

https://arxiv.org/pdf/0712.3332.pdf "Extreme genetic code optimality from a molecular dynamics calculation of amino acid polar requirement" (2008)

These papers were very interesting then. I remember Carl Woese mentioning the polar requirement in class in 2006 and his research that he was working on at the time.

postscript: Life really is physics in a way that requires focus on the physical aspects of nature. But on a day to day basis, this fact is not simply grasped or known.

1987: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC373105/pdf/microrev00049-0051.pdf Woese wrote a 51 page paper on Bacterial Evolution, and was aware of the missing connection that microbes had to the modern genetic code (addition: In the MAINSTREAM Molecular Biology consensus). I haven't read the entire paper, but the first page already resembles his later treatises in the mid 2000s.

A Tale of Woese, 1998  https://www.scribd.com/document/16300262/A-Tale-of-Woese

"All the junk written about Beethoven's irascible personality does not add at all to the appreciation of his music."

"Woese says part of the skeptical stance to the 1977 report could be traced back to classical microbiology's quiet divorce from the decade's evolutionary thinking. “There was a disconnect between Darwinists, who had taken over evolution, and microbiologists, who had no use for Darwinian natural selection,” he says. To make matters worse, molecular biology's application-oriented approach, he adds, smothered evolutionary considerations of life. “There was a tacit agreement between evolutionists and molecular biologists—en entente curieuse—that neither group would criticize the other.” Add to these reasons microbiologists’ reluctance to abandon the existing classification of life into eukaryotes and prokaryotes, and Woese's phylogenetic classification met with widespread resistance. “By then, the concept of prokaryotes had become firmly entrenched. When the phylogenetic classification was proposed, it was as if a crutch had been taken away,” he recalls."

"Dyson won numerous scientific awards, but never a Nobel Prize. Nobel physics laureate Steven Weinberg said that the Nobel committee "fleeced" Dyson, but Dyson remarked in 2009, "I think it's almost true without exception if you want to win a Nobel Prize, you should have a long attention span, get hold of some deep and important problem and stay with it for ten years. That wasn't my style."[11]'

It's true that in order to be considered an expert, one typically has to have worked in a field for a number of years. Yet, generalists are a rarer breed, and, are just as resourceful at "solving" or "working" on academic problems/issues than those in highly specialized fields. In fact, while many question the value of tenure in a world where industry dominates the employment sector, a defense of tenured generalists should gain new support, should academia seek to remain relevant and maintain its "editorial independence" on the direction of applied sciences.

"Although adaptation to changing circumstances is easier with a diverse knowledge base,
“Renaissance people” or polymaths are rare, because specialization is rewarded more
generously in the short term. By crediting focused accomplishments, the existing reward
system of grants, awards and promotions creates silos of knowledge with suppressed cross
fertilization. This unfortunate backdrop only highlights the essential role played by
generalists. Those who cross boundaries of disciplines act as butterflies that pollinate flowers
unintentionally by carrying pollen stuck to their bellies. Occasional random winds can
accomplish the same outcome but with a reduced efficiency and vigor."

While peer-reviewed research papers in academia do now typically include disclaimers on whether any of the researchers claim a conflict of interest, there remains a strong influence of corporate-funded research in higher education, which results in a very uncritical, pro-industry academic track for many scientific degrees. In fact, some degrees appear to be no more than a conveyor belt for positions for dense IP trolls and non-practicing patent entities (NPEs).

If one were to follow the trajectory of the brain drain after the Manhattan Project, one can see that the physicists who did not want to develop weapons of war, left to study Biology in the late 1940s- early 60s (e.g. Pasteur Institute) after Hershey and Chase's experiment on DNA. Other scientists later went on to develop the internet. 

With the popularity of the Christopher Nolan film, Oppenheimer, being released this weekend, I have been reading some memoranda from other post-WWII periods that underscore the dangers of nuclear warfare: https://archive.org/details/The1958TaiwanStraitsCrisisADocumentedHistory_201712

Abridged supplement (not a substitute): https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_memoranda/RM4900.html (Some margins are more legible in this version, even though it is missing 46+ pages)

While not as publicized as the Cuban Missile Crisis, the 1958 Taiwan Straits crisis details (and posted by the late Daniel Ellsberg in 2021) the near-miscalculations of Chinese Communist and Chinese Nationalist forces in the vicinity of present-day Kinmen islands.
